BinStorm is a React Native styling utility for rapidly building custom user interfaces

It is different from frameworks like Shoutem, Native Base, or UI Kitten in that it's not a UI kit.

It doesn't have a default theme, and there are no built-in UI components.

But importantly, it contains all the helpers that will help you to build your application design. Rather than pre-defined components & theme which controls how your app should look.

If you're looking for a framework that comes with prebuilt widgets/components to build your app with, BinStorm might not be the right framework for you. 

## Utility-first

Creating a framework for building custom UIs means you can't provide abstractions at the usual level of buttons, forms, cards, navbars, etc.

Instead, BinStorm provides highly composable, low-level utility classes that make it easy to build complex user interfaces without encouraging any two apps to look the same.

Here's an example of a contact card component built with BinStorm without writing a single line of style:

<snack-preview snack-name="contact-card" />
