# What is BinStorm?

### BinStorm is a React Native styling utility for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

BinStorm is different from frameworks like Shoutem, Native Base, or UI Kitten in that it's not a UI kit.

It doesn't have a default theme, and there are no built-in UI components.

On the flip side, it also has no opinion about how your app should look and doesn't impose design decisions that you have to fight to undo.

If you're looking for a framework that comes with a menu of predesigned widgets to build your app with, BinStorm might not be the right framework for you.

But if you want a huge head start implementing a custom design with its own identity, BinStorm might be just what you're looking for.

## Utility-first

Creating a framework for building custom UIs means you can't provide abstractions at the usual level of buttons, forms, cards, navbars, etc.

Instead, BinStorm provides highly composable, low-level utility classes that make it easy to build complex user interfaces without encouraging any two apps to look the same.

Here's an example of a contact card component built with BinStorm without writing a single line of style:

<snack-preview snack-name="contact-card" />
